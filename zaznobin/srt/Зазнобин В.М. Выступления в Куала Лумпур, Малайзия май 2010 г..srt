00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,120
wonderful best

9
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:54,920
university I would like to represent to

10
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:58,920
you the Contemporary Russian Outlook

11
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:01,920
insight into the challenges of

12
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,920
globalization

13
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:12,080
for

14
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,799
Barak probably you have heard about the

15
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,640
Contemporary the nowadays the present

16
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:20,280
day advisor to President Barack Obama on

17
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,280
geopolitical issues Mr

18
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,920
barana he is representing the American

19
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:32,439
Outlook into the globalization

20
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,439
challenges

21
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:47,600
problem but his uh ideas regarding the

22
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:52,920
globalization and the challenges of

23
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,920
viations are according to our view are

24
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,840
inadequate so actually I will deliver a

25
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,799
lecture regarding this issue I will try

26
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,799
try to develop all

27
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,599
this in our view globalization is an

28
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,239
objective process meaning that

29
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:20,640
globalization is the concentration of

30
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:20,640
the productive forces of

31
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:31,760
humanity we understand that humanity is

32
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,760
single kind is Unified kind and a sing

33
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,680
Spirit

34
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:45,159
basically we understand that

35
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:48,360
globalization process as a mean as a as

36
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:50,360
a as as it is uh related to the

37
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,519
concentration of the productive forces

38
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,720
of the entire human kind is an objective

39
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:58,760
process and the president of the Russian

40
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:01,760
Federation used to be speaking all

41
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,760
this

42
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:10,920
but the control over this process is

43
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,920
subjective is dependent on the

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,400
will so what is the current Global

45
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,760
challenge to the entire humankind the

46
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,760
present

47
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,040
day

48
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:35,480
we will start with a very important

49
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:38,920
issue in this regard is we will have to

50
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:41,640
look at the way the change of social

51
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:44,560
behavior logic took place in the middle

52
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,560
of the 20th

53
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:56,000
century the whole humankind in

54
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:56,000
information wise is the two level

55
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,680
system

56
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:07,640
so the information Exchange in the

57
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,879
humankind in the society has two levels

58
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:14,439
the one level is that information is

59
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:14,439
changed at genetical level genetic

60
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:22,240
level as you can see it on the screen so

61
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:26,320
the genetic uh the genetic information

62
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:28,560
change is stable over time it changes

63
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,600
the change of this uh of this process is

64
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,600
the change of the generation

65
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:45,479
we have analyzed the written history of

66
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:49,479
humankind and we assess this written

67
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:51,840
history of humankind uh as deep as 7,000

68
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:51,840
years

69
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:02,639
ago we understand that each time the

70
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,639
generation changes one time in 25 years

71
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,360
approximately and that should not be new

72
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:13,720
to you that the first generation is

73
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,720
delivering new

74
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,600
ideas the second generation is striving

75
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,960
to implement these ideas to bring them

76
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,960
into

77
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:31,479
life the third generation keeps the

78
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:31,479
inertia of that press

79
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:36,639
and the fourth generation overthrows

80
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,639
what has been

81
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:49,479
done but the society is informatively

82
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:49,479
changed all also on the social level as

83
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:59,639
well and the main thing which brings uh

84
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:02,880
uh brings clue to the process of social

85
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:02,880
renovation are the

86
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:15,440
Technologies if you have a deep inside

87
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:19,680
the historical background say at 5,000

88
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,680
years ago then you could

89
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,800
notice that the world has been unchanged

90
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,520
for many many many Generations over the

91
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,520
last thousand

92
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:43,759
years which means that technologically

93
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:48,120
the main uh social and the main

94
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,120
technological branches of the life of

95
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:55,400
society uh during the life of the same

96
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,680
technologist hundreds or tens and

97
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:01,400
hundreds of generations went through the

98
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,400
same technological envir

99
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,080
enironment we now live in the 21st

100
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,960
century and it is absolutely common

101
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,240
knowledge to us living in the 21st

102
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:25,039
century that Technologies change many

103
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,479
form many times over this the lifetime

104
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:31,319
of one

105
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:31,319
generation but

106
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,639
if you put these two processes the

107
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:42,280
biological time and the so-called social

108
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:42,280
time in

109
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:50,199
comparison you can see is this as the

110
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,400
lines for rate of information change in

111
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:52,400
the

112
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:04,199
society green line is the stable line of

113
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:06,479
change of information on genetical level

114
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:06,479
of

115
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:18,319
humankind the information change on

116
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:18,319
social level is

117
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,599
variable

118
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,399
if this is objectively so so then the

119
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:37,560
two lines the green line which is

120
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:40,000
Constantine and the red line which is

121
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:42,440
rival going up they should meet at one

122
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,440
certain

123
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:50,959
point and we were much interested in the

124
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:53,120
period when these two lines overlapped

125
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:56,519
with each

126
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:59,839
other so you can see that the yellow uh

127
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:03,040
the yellow part of of the scene is

128
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:06,120
is is exactly marking the period when

129
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:09,320
the two uh when the two lines glided

130
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,320
when they got into

131
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:16,959
related and tell you exactly that that

132
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:20,440
period of time was very dangerous period

133
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,440
of time for the entire

134
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:33,120
humankind during that time marked as

135
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:35,480
yellow the two World Wars occurred on

136
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,480
planet

137
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:44,240
Earth

138
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:49,040
the the first world war started in

139
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,040
1914 and the second world war started in

140
00:09:54,959 --> 00:10:03,519
1939 that was exactly the period when

141
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:03,519
the frequency of the two processes were

142
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:14,120
equal and also as you may remember at

143
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:18,680
that period of time the whole globe the

144
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:18,680
whole planet was covered by a wave of

145
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,880
revolutions revolutions were not only in

146
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:34,959
Russia but took place in China in Mexico

147
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:37,639
India elsewhere so and it all ended by

148
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,639
the end of the

149
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:49,800
50s by the end of that period human kind

150
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,800
delivered an atomic

151
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:03,040
bomb the appearance of the nuclear

152
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,320
weapons and effective uh use of nuclear

153
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,160
weapons as you know from history

154
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:10,240
displayed to all the humanity

155
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:12,920
impossibility of waging big Wars with

156
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,920
with the nuclear

157
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:24,279
weapons so exactly that period which is

158
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:27,279
marked with yellow here on the screen

159
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:30,959
was named by us the period of the change

160
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,959
of social behavior

161
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:44,279
logic that's because if we look into the

162
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,760
period which which is before this period

163
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,760
marked as

164
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:01,760
yellow we notice one very important

165
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,480
thing that a man living before that

166
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,920
period if that man would acquire some

167
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,600
knowledge could be absolutely confident

168
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:12,120
that this knowledge will be enough for

169
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:16,360
his lifetime and even for the lifetime

170
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:16,360
of his sons daughters and grandsons and

171
00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:26,839
granddaughters that was the period of

172
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:26,839
the predominance and acquiring of factal

173
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880
knowledge

174
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:38,360
and now after that yellow line we we

175
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:41,240
understand that it is now the third

176
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:44,480
generation entering life in the New

177
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,480
Logic of social

178
00:12:54,519 --> 00:13:00,600
behavior and even the students of today

179
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:03,240
they absolutely easily understand that

180
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:06,079
the factology facts which they are

181
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:08,680
receiving during the course of Education

182
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:11,639
become sometimes become obsolete when

183
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,639
they end this

184
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:23,360
education that is why we are sure that

185
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:25,720
the new determining factor for the

186
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:29,320
education of the next generation of this

187
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:32,600
generation is the methodological educ

188
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,600
it is the predominant

189
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,480
factor in different countries people who

190
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,320
do not see this problem who do not

191
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:46,279
understand this problem try to solve

192
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,279
that in different

193
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:56,959
ways say in the United States of America

194
00:13:54,160 --> 00:14:00,519
they try to make the period of Education

195
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:03,360
more extensive

196
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:03,360
same about

197
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:10,839
Russia and uh say education the

198
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,880
secondary education in Russia has

199
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:13,880
reached 12

200
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,519
years but it is interesting to note that

201
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:24,839
if the school boys and school girls are

202
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:27,680
given the methodological grounds for

203
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:30,560
acquiring new

204
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,639
knowledge

205
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:36,040
then the process of such education

206
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,040
without losing any quality of

207
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,600
it can be minimized to say seven or

208
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,600
eight

209
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,920
years apart from that what I have told

210
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,680
you you may notice the growing

211
00:14:54,920 --> 00:15:00,680
catastrophic events all over

212
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,680
Earth

213
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:08,600
the number of social catastrophes and

214
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:11,880
the number of technogen genetic

215
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,880
catastroph is growing

216
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:25,360
rapidly we also see it as the the fact

217
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:28,040
that that people do not understand that

218
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:30,600
the change of social behavior logic has

219
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,600
already

220
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:40,839
occurred so what is the the global

221
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:40,839
Society what is the Contemporary Society

222
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:48,000
currently we called that Society the mob

223
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,000
Elite

224
00:15:55,959 --> 00:16:03,839
Society we have a definition for the mob

225
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:07,120
mob is a crowd of of people who live

226
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:10,360
according to the writings and analyze

227
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,360
things according to some

228
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,800
authorities according to the uh to the

229
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,160
to the authorities of the leaders

230
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,800
according to the authorities of the

231
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:28,920
sacred writings according to authority

232
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:33,000
of any other uh Authority in the society

233
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:36,880
or texts which can be uh which can be

234
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,880
even uh distorted or

235
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:46,360
misunderstood and we understand that

236
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:49,560
this mob Elite Society in the current

237
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:51,319
New Logic of social behavior is not I

238
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:54,759
cannot leave

239
00:16:51,319 --> 00:16:54,759
out it will

240
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:03,079
perish

241
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:06,439
and we understand that in order to to

242
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:10,959
turn this mob into people we have to

243
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:10,959
change or dramatically change the

244
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:21,360
culture so basically this is the key

245
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:24,039
point for the investigation for the

246
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:27,400
studies which is being done by a group

247
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:29,440
of scientists which I'm now here

248
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,360
representing

249
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:35,520
how what we should do in order to

250
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,520
facilitate that mob becomes

251
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:47,679
people so I'm now going to briefly

252
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:50,400
deliver to you some latest studies the

253
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,400
results of these

254
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:57,600
studies we have identified the so-called

255
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:02,600
complete function of control of the

256
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,600
social behavior a control full function

257
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:07,799
cff please pay attention to these

258
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:19,679
schemes we have identified seven stages

259
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:19,679
of the complete of the full Control

260
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:32,799
Function they do objectively exist

261
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:36,760
whenever a a person wants to take his

262
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,760
own mentality under

263
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:45,679
control it is definitely applicable to

264
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:49,200
the control of the social groups

265
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:52,200
starting with say business starting with

266
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,200
production

267
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:01,880
yes

268
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,919
even if you look carefully at yourself

269
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:06,520
at your motivations and behavior you

270
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:11,360
will see that all these seven functions

271
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:11,360
are present all the seven factors are

272
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:27,159
present at uh stage one of this process

273
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:30,240
you identify the new factor which is

274
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:30,240
affecting your en

275
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:40,960
enironment so at this very exact moment

276
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:45,919
you are solving a task to identify

277
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,919
whether this is new or not new to

278
00:19:53,240 --> 00:20:00,080
you uh the Holy Quran has uh Surah 25

279
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:07,200
which is called Alan which is in Russian

280
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:07,200
called the uh uh the determination the

281
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:16,280
telling we understand that God Allah

282
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:18,640
gives this determining the uh ability to

283
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:22,640
tell things according to the

284
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,640
Consciousness and according to the heart

285
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:33,120
condition and you may already notice

286
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:35,600
that for some people the new knowledge

287
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,600
is not

288
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:43,760
existent and others would immediately

289
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,760
identify ah this is new this is new

290
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:51,760
knowledge on the second stage of the

291
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,760
control full

292
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,960
function you are trying to

293
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:04,320
the new knowledge into the system of

294
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:08,240
your stereotypes into the system of your

295
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,240
mental stereotypes which you already

296
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:13,360
have this is the most difficult task for

297
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:20,320
you you will have to look into your old

298
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:20,320
existing

299
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:27,840
stereotypes and somehow position this

300
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:30,600
new Factor new information into the

301
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,600
system system of

302
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:37,320
stereotypes once you have identified

303
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,559
this new factor and you paid attention

304
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,559
to

305
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:44,279
it then you definitely need that for

306
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:52,600
something so then you start to create

307
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,600
your own Vector of

308
00:21:53,760 --> 00:22:00,000
goals in regards to this new

309
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:02,159
Factor

310
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,520
basically the vector of goals is a list

311
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,520
of your

312
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:08,799
wishes in some decent

313
00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:17,960
order on the first uh place in your

314
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,440
vector of goals you put your goal your

315
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:23,880
aim which is the last uh to get rid of

316
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,880
if need

317
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
be

318
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,760
and the last place is occupied by a goal

319
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,600
which you can easily get rid of when you

320
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,600
solve some other

321
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:49,440
problems so each of the humans living on

322
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,440
Earth does do does possess some certain

323
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:58,480
goals what do you do is you Ed your

324
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,880
newly identified vector of goals

325
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:04,880
regarding new information have received

326
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,880
into your existing Vector of

327
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:13,960
goals probably you will have to overlook

328
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:17,640
and oversee and change the hierarchy of

329
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,640
the goals in your vector of

330
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:29,880
goals and on the fourth stage you create

331
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:29,880
a con concept for reaching these goals

332
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:38,440
the fifth stage is more understandable

333
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:43,279
to use so you create a structure or a

334
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:43,279
purpose vehicle in order to reach these

335
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:51,679
goals and Stage six you're just viewing

336
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:53,720
and contr and uh supervising your

337
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:56,480
vehicle which you have created specially

338
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,480
to reach that

339
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880
goals

340
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:08,760
then at stage seven you either continue

341
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:12,320
to maintain these vehicles or you

342
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,320
liquidate these vehicles as

343
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:18,440
needless or if you have reached the

344
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:22,320
goals which you have set in front of

345
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:26,039
you so basically these are the seven

346
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:30,240
stages of full Control

347
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:30,240
Function they are all always

348
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:39,039
present if anyone of the stages is

349
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,760
missing is missing regarding your

350
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,840
information which you are putting into

351
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:45,279
that

352
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:48,000
stage then it is someone else who is

353
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:48,000
doing that for

354
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:56,559
you but then it's not you who

355
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:56,559
control who control

356
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:04,039
yourself and and controls that processes

357
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,039
which you want to to keep under your

358
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:22,240
control but control F function is always

359
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:26,679
present but you can definitely deliver

360
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:29,039
more detailed uh picture of each of the

361
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:31,279
stages

362
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,960
so I would like to ask you one single

363
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:35,120
question I would like to address to all

364
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,120
of

365
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:53,240
you can you tell me now the president

366
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:56,000
the king or the General Secretary of any

367
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:58,640
country who is controlling the first

368
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,640
four stages of the complete

369
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,640
Control

370
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:09,200
Function that is not done by the

371
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:09,200
president of the United

372
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:14,279
States that is not done by the president

373
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:19,159
of

374
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:19,159
Russia that is not done by no

375
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:27,240
one although there should be someone who

376
00:26:24,399 --> 00:26:28,520
controls the first four stages of the

377
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,000
complete

378
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,000
Control

379
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:39,200
Function that is why next point is very

380
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:43,440
important we have to talk about the

381
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,440
kinds of power in the

382
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:56,600
social we understand that power is the

383
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:59,600
realized the implemented capability to

384
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,600
control

385
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:09,320
for you it is very common to understand

386
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,320
that there are three kinds of

387
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:16,880
Power the legislative

388
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:21,080
power the executive

389
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:23,799
power and judicial

390
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:26,600
power these are common things and you

391
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:29,520
know uh something which is known

392
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,520
everywhere in the world

393
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:37,360
World in reality however there are not

394
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,360
three but five kinds of

395
00:27:38,919 --> 00:27:43,080
Power which work all

396
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:49,760
together and there is in reality there

397
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:52,000
is no division of powers they work all

398
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,000
as

399
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:01,080
one

400
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:05,399
as you remember at stage four of this e

401
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:05,399
you have to create your own concept of

402
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:16,000
control so those who control the first

403
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:19,000
four stages of the complete Control

404
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Function

405
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:25,720
exist but it is not common knowledge

406
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:29,440
that it is not really uh something which

407
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:29,440
is widely discussed you

408
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:37,279
and the point is not that this kind of

409
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:37,279
power is hidden away from everybody's

410
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:46,760
eye you might know that if some process

411
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:46,760
of some event

412
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:54,760
exists and there is an image in the

413
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,760
Society of such a process or such an

414
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:02,799
event but if you do not have the

415
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:05,159
adequate naming for such an event or

416
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,159
such a

417
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:12,159
process then this process of this event

418
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,159
is sort of not

419
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:20,919
existent that's exactly what is

420
00:29:18,279 --> 00:29:25,360
happening now to that kind of power

421
00:29:20,919 --> 00:29:25,360
which we called the conceptual

422
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:33,720
power Global predictor we called that

423
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:37,080
conceptual power related to Earth as a

424
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:37,080
whole the global

425
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:42,760
predictor control means

426
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:50,799
prediction and we we know that Napoleon

427
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:53,840
was the first politician to put that

428
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:53,840
into these exact

429
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,320
words

430
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:05,880
when now President Putin was asked once

431
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:09,559
what gift he would like to have he said

432
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:09,559
I would like to have the gift of

433
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:18,240
prediction So This Global conceptual

434
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:25,919
power was formed according to our ideas

435
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,919
in ancient

436
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:32,399
Egypt

437
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:34,840
approximately from 4 to 5,000 years

438
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,840
before

439
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:43,320
Christ and once having emerged it didn't

440
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:43,320
go anywhere it did not

441
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:53,480
vanish conceptual power are the

442
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:56,480
ideas and

443
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:59,519
people who are bearing these ideas or

444
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,840
who are capable to adjust these ideas

445
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,840
with

446
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:11,720
time ancient Egypt was met was

447
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:11,720
controlled by the 22

448
00:31:12,919 --> 00:31:20,720
heropants herant translated from the

449
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:20,720
Greek language are the people who know

450
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:28,279
tomorrow they split it into two teams of

451
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:30,799
11 11 in the north and 11 in the south

452
00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:30,799
of the

453
00:31:32,919 --> 00:31:37,880
country it was them who created the

454
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:47,000
procedure the procedure which would as a

455
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:50,600
result of which we would receive

456
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:53,200
unanimity and a consens consens

457
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:56,159
regarding various

458
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:59,519
issues and not only just by

459
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:02,440
voting like it is accepted in all the de

460
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:02,440
democracies of the

461
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:12,559
world through the use of the same

462
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:15,000
methodology for the search of Truth

463
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:15,000
which they

464
00:32:15,639 --> 00:32:20,120
possessed you may ask me why ancient

465
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,080
Egypt

466
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:36,760
you know that 5,000 years ago only Egypt

467
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:41,279
was possessing the uh the

468
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:41,279
historically uh stable written

469
00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:46,760
Culture by analyzing these written

470
00:32:47,639 --> 00:32:52,840
artifacts which refer to the times of

471
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:56,039
the Jer

472
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:59,039
far it's approximately 3,000

473
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:59,039
years

474
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:11,279
at those time analyzing the situation

475
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:13,240
they have managed to see the first stage

476
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:16,559
of the complete function of control they

477
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:20,000
have identified the new thing which is

478
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:20,000
the which is now called

479
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:27,080
globalization they were managed they

480
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:30,120
managed to understand the globalization

481
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:30,120
is an objective

482
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:39,880
process and the control of the

483
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:39,880
globalization is subjective

484
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:47,039
process they were the first to uh to go

485
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:50,000
through the first four stages of the

486
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:50,000
complete control

487
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:58,960
function and they have elaborated and

488
00:33:53,639 --> 00:33:58,960
brought about uh the global concept of

489
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:04,639
control which you know all of you and

490
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,399
everyone of

491
00:34:04,639 --> 00:34:08,399
you and this is the

492
00:34:12,919 --> 00:34:19,119
Bible the Bible is definitely not a

493
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:21,399
product of mentality of a nedic tribe

494
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:21,399
called

495
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:28,879
Jews Bible is a very serious book in

496
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:28,879
this regard

497
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:37,320
this the biblical concept or the concept

498
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:39,720
of the Bible dominates now throughout

499
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,720
the whole

500
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:47,599
world culture is always uh determined by

501
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:47,599
the

502
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:56,159
concept in order to understand the

503
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:59,880
concept you will have to analyze and

504
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,880
study the culture in which you are

505
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:07,359
living that is exactly the point where

506
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,359
we we have studed our

507
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:17,960
research we started to make deep

508
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,960
research of the culture of the X

509
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:23,160
USSR Western Europe and the United

510
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,160
States of

511
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:34,200
America this culture is

512
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:34,200
displayed widely in museums in music in

513
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,680
architecture there are definitely other

514
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:43,119
cultures like the culture of

515
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:46,760
Islam theist

516
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:49,440
orist huist

517
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:51,359
culture but it is the

518
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:54,640
Bible which

519
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:54,640
dominates in the

520
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:00,720
society

521
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:02,400
and therefore the Western culture is

522
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:05,040
aggressively pushing straight forward

523
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,040
throughout the whole

524
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:10,880
world I visited India once and I

525
00:36:09,319 --> 00:36:14,079
delivering a

526
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,079
lecture in

527
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:24,520
India I heard I heard an objection from

528
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:27,440
one of the leaders and he said that look

529
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:29,960
over the last 200 years there are no

530
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:32,520
more symbols of any Western culture left

531
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:35,319
in India

532
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:37,359
nothing and then I raised a computer and

533
00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:41,119
cell mobile

534
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:41,119
phone I show them the

535
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:51,760
Automobiles and I told him that you know

536
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,480
sometimes things speak on a certain

537
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:56,880
language with with

538
00:36:54,480 --> 00:37:00,160
people and this language is also also

539
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,160
Bor by the biblical

540
00:37:02,319 --> 00:37:10,040
culture this biblical culture gave birth

541
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:10,040
to the technosphere which we are now

542
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:18,800
using and whatever we do in order to

543
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,800
defend our

544
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,240
culture you all

545
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:28,599
know

546
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,200
you all know that the main cultural

547
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,960
center of the western biblical

548
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:39,400
civilization which is called the

549
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:41,960
Hollywood it is penetrating all all

550
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,960
parts of the

551
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:49,640
world may ask why the biblical culture

552
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:54,280
of the

553
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:54,280
West has become to dominate in the

554
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:58,599
society

555
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:06,319
my answer is that only in the Bible you

556
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:09,760
can feel you can see the exact exactly

557
00:38:06,319 --> 00:38:13,680
set and straightforwardly

558
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,680
put sociological

559
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:26,119
Doctrine it sounds like that that and he

560
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:29,119
is using now the the citing the Bible he

561
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:30,920
says that you should not give your

562
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:32,839
brother

563
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:35,240
silver

564
00:38:32,839 --> 00:38:39,079
bread or

565
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:41,640
any silver or bread or any other things

566
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:43,720
that you can give to other nations in

567
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:47,040
usually

568
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:49,760
ideas if you give that to us in in in

569
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:53,560
terms of usury to other peoples then you

570
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,560
will re all over the other

571
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,119
peoples and those peoples who will not

572
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,960
be

573
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:03,560
who would not like to be your

574
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:03,560
servants they will be

575
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:10,720
perished from our Viewpoint this is

576
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:13,160
direct aggression towards the whole the

577
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,160
entire

578
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:20,920
humankind and Quran was uh given to

579
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:28,440
Muhammad in order to stop that

580
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:28,440
conceptual aggression in the world

581
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:35,240
we think that there were three

582
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:47,160
Revelations first revelation was given

583
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:50,079
on the very upside of the mop Elite

584
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:50,079
pyramid to the

585
00:39:53,040 --> 00:40:00,440
pH to the 10th Faron of the 18th Dynasty

586
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,440
13th century before

587
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,839
Christ that far broke all ties with the

588
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:12,040
uh

589
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:12,040
withan of

590
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:19,640
am and he was the first to raise the

591
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,640
issue of one single

592
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:28,960
God and he was putting this into these

593
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:28,960
verses of the him and of

594
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:43,480
Aton but the uh the priest hierarchy put

595
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:43,480
this undercover put this Anem

596
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:50,440
undercover and the world knew about

597
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:53,520
learned about this Anon only at the end

598
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:53,520
of 19th

599
00:40:54,040 --> 00:41:00,359
century next Revelation was given to is

600
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,359
to to to the

601
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:10,720
Christ knew he was literate man he knew

602
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,720
writing he he could

603
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:15,839
read but he didn't not put the

604
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,839
Revelation on

605
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:22,880
paper so he went to the people with just

606
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,880
verbal

607
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:29,520
prophesies

608
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:35,839
he definitely knew that his teaching

609
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:35,839
will be uh further uh perverted

610
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:42,560
by Third Revelation was given to

611
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:51,440
Muhammad in

612
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:55,240
Russia we have many

613
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:58,240
people who study all the three

614
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,240
Revelations

615
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:05,280
we have compared the of Aton which is

616
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,280
13th century

617
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:11,240
BC the contents of Quran which is

618
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:14,119
seventh

619
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:17,880
century these two Revelations are

620
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:17,880
divided by 2,000

621
00:42:20,119 --> 00:42:23,960
years we have applied some computer

622
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:26,599
Technologies in order to make

623
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:29,640
comparative assessment of what what is

624
00:42:26,599 --> 00:42:29,640
exactly the contents

625
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:36,800
about when we have done that we were

626
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:39,599
amazed and astonished not only by the uh

627
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,599
Unity of the

628
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:49,160
contents but also the text and the the

629
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:49,160
frequency and the rhythmic of these

630
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:57,720
Revelations uh we call it the white

631
00:42:54,640 --> 00:43:00,000
poetry so it's uh in Russian it's called

632
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:04,599
White poet we have the white poetic

633
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,599
effect present in both these

634
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:15,480
Revelations and the fact which we see

635
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:19,119
now is the standoff between the world of

636
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:19,119
Islam and the world of

637
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:29,720
Bible is the result that in Quran you

638
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:32,599
have an absolutely fixed right

639
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:32,599
definition of

640
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:41,839
usury and this is an absolutely directly

641
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,839
fixed negative approach to

642
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:52,040
usury from that I should say that there

643
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:55,520
is quranic quranic

644
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:59,800
Islam and we understand that it is the

645
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:59,800
historic Ally set

646
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:06,920
Islam find difference between quranic

647
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:06,920
Islam and historically set

648
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:15,640
Islam the point is that Muslims all over

649
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:18,920
the world cannot

650
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:20,880
unite and divided themselves into shs

651
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:25,000
and

652
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:28,000
sunnit there is no saying in Quran about

653
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
that

654
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:35,160
similar similar thing absolutely similar

655
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,160
thing is with

656
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:43,040
Christianity the historically set

657
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:45,400
Christianity and the teaching of Isa the

658
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:48,280
teaching of

659
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:51,520
Christ are far far far away from each

660
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:51,520
other was long away

661
00:44:52,079 --> 00:45:00,359
from I'm sorry to make this uh hisorical

662
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:00,359
backgrounds delivering to

663
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,760
you but I am convinced that I'm talking

664
00:45:05,559 --> 00:45:08,760
to the high level of

665
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:13,440
audience and I would like you to

666
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:24,200
understand in Russia there is definitely

667
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:27,599
some some understanding of the religious

668
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:30,839
uh faiths and religious uh beliefs by

669
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:30,839
far more more

670
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:41,480
advanced the historically said religion

671
00:45:38,839 --> 00:45:45,119
the the teachings themselves are

672
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:45,119
different in a ways similar

673
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:53,359
to similar to the fact how they decorate

674
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:55,920
an icon in Russia from the icon itself

675
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:57,960
so make they make these gold decorations

676
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:02,400
covering almost all kinds of icons and

677
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:02,400
that the icon itself is not visible

678
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:12,559
sometimes we uh we actually uh make

679
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:15,480
difference between trust to God and

680
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:15,480
trust in

681
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:23,720
God and this is sort of uh giving you

682
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:27,800
guidance further how trust in God

683
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:27,800
differs from trust to God

684
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,680
so the whole humankind is now on the

685
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:42,160
edge of overcoming the real

686
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:47,760
atheism and we have atheism of the two

687
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:52,119
times as we

688
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:57,800
see the soal idealistic

689
00:46:52,119 --> 00:46:57,800
atheism and materialistic atheism

690
00:47:00,599 --> 00:47:08,240
in Russia over 1,000 years we have been

691
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:08,240
overcoming the idealistic

692
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:15,319
atheism idealistic atheism of all the

693
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:15,319
churches named after

694
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:22,200
Christ also in Russia we had three

695
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:24,720
generations of overcoming the

696
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:27,720
materialist atheism of

697
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,720
marxist

698
00:47:31,319 --> 00:47:36,520
basically the point of Russia is that

699
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:38,760
Russia in some in this regard is by far

700
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:41,839
and more advanced than other countries

701
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:41,839
they have experienced a

702
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:52,000
lot to put it in plain terms the the

703
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:54,640
idealistic atheists say God exists but

704
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,400
they they make some presumptions about

705
00:47:54,640 --> 00:48:00,559
God which is is not inherent to God and

706
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:00,559
that's why they they

707
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:06,440
atheists sometimes in Russia they will

708
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:09,760
say that God is is a grandfather with a

709
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:09,760
beard or something like

710
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:17,559
that that Jesus Christ is the Son of

711
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:19,280
God although Quran speaks absolutely

712
00:48:17,559 --> 00:48:22,359
right on this

713
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:24,640
point that God Allah doesn't have no

714
00:48:22,359 --> 00:48:27,640
children no

715
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:27,640
helpers

716
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:37,640
materialists material atheists are

717
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:40,200
absolutely simple they say okay there is

718
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:40,200
no God at

719
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:46,040
all when you ask this material atheist

720
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:50,280
what is exist in there they would said

721
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:50,280
okay nature exists and some laws

722
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:56,920
exists and basically what they do they

723
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:59,240
make they give the tra of God to the

724
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:59,240
God's

725
00:49:01,799 --> 00:49:06,799
creation Quran says this that

726
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:09,119
presumption does not cannot deprive you

727
00:49:06,799 --> 00:49:09,119
from the

728
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:16,640
truth I'm getting back to the to to my

729
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:16,640
lecture

730
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:24,839
again those who represent this

731
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:27,520
conceptual power know that in very great

732
00:49:24,839 --> 00:49:27,520
detail

733
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:38,400
is they make the collision between the

734
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:40,839
two different types of this atheism they

735
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:44,559
use they make these collisions between

736
00:49:40,839 --> 00:49:44,559
the the many times of

737
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:58,720
atheism so basically the Islamic Terror

738
00:49:55,799 --> 00:50:00,760
is the result of such collisions because

739
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:05,040
it's different understanding of the true

740
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:05,040
Islamic and quranic Islam and the

741
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:16,520
historical this is also an aggression

742
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:18,240
against Islam so the so-called Islamic

743
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:20,839
terrorism is a sort of biblical

744
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,839
aggression

745
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:27,440
towards so there are five kinds of

746
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:27,440
Power

747
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:35,000
you already know something about the

748
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:35,000
true nature of the conceptual

749
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:47,280
power its main uh tra of character is

750
00:50:44,799 --> 00:50:49,400
that this kind of power is autocreated

751
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:52,000
by its nature and it disregards all

752
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:52,000
Democratic

753
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:58,640
procedures you cannot be elected to the

754
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,640
conceptual

755
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:06,319
power you cannot definitely pay the bill

756
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:06,319
and get elected to the

757
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:15,040
conceptual and you cannot be there by a

758
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:15,040
recommendation of some high level

759
00:51:24,359 --> 00:51:27,359
authorities

760
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:33,119
it's uh actually one point is that the

761
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:36,799
current mop Elite Society is run under

762
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:38,760
the formula that each individual Works

763
00:51:36,799 --> 00:51:41,640
to the measure of understanding things

764
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:42,760
for himself and for the measure of non

765
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:44,920
understanding things he works for

766
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:47,440
someone who understands more so

767
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:50,440
basically the true thing is that you can

768
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:54,160
be there in the conceptual Power by the

769
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:54,160
measure of your understanding of

770
00:51:54,359 --> 00:51:57,359
things

771
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:08,240
so conceptual power is the highest intas

772
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:08,240
Social Power which is their

773
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:15,920
existent conceptual power affects uh

774
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,920
superstate

775
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:27,000
control according to the formula which

776
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:31,920
was once mentioned by plutar who said

777
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,920
that you control but you as well being

778
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:43,119
controlled conceptual power brings about

779
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:43,119
the concept for the whole

780
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:59,160
man

781
00:52:56,200 --> 00:53:01,520
even when this concept is anti-human by

782
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:03,839
its nature and they have to think how to

783
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:06,079
put this concept into acceptable terms

784
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:08,119
for the public mentality then they would

785
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:10,359
need some ideologies to wrap this

786
00:53:08,119 --> 00:53:13,520
concept into

787
00:53:10,359 --> 00:53:17,520
applicable terminology so the second

788
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:17,520
kind of power is ideological

789
00:53:18,359 --> 00:53:22,599
power and then we come down to the kinds

790
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:27,160
of Power which we all already know is

791
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:27,160
legislative number three

792
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:33,599
what they do is basically based on the

793
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:36,760
concept they based on the concept and

794
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:39,200
based on the current ideology they

795
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:39,200
create

796
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:49,640
laws and then comes executive or

797
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:52,920
administrative power and executive power

798
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:57,160
implements these laws by the use of

799
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:57,160
various uh leverages they they

800
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:03,040
us and finally we come down to judicial

801
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:10,760
power which its main goal is to defend

802
00:54:07,799 --> 00:54:14,680
the ruling the dominating concept

803
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:14,680
against interference of other

804
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:25,720
Concepts I would like to say that in

805
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:28,799
Russia currently nowadays we have we

806
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:31,920
have the alternative concept to the

807
00:54:28,799 --> 00:54:31,920
existing biblical

808
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:42,119
concept it is uncovers and unveils all

809
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:42,119
the necessary information and

810
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:50,160
knowledge we called that ladies and

811

00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:18,160
first of all I would like to thank

815
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:18,160

that is true four months ago we had very

819
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:41,839
very important and very informative

820
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,839
meeting with

821
00:55:44,359 --> 00:55:50,839
Mr it considered the current situation

822
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:50,839
of the Islam Islam

823
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,079
world

824
00:55:56,240 --> 00:56:00,760
we also spoke about the differences

825
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:04,240
between the historical Islam and the

826
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:04,240
real true quranic

827
00:56:09,559 --> 00:56:15,720
Islam I could definitely deliver a very

828
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:18,799
extended speech or lecture in this

829
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:18,799
regard to theed

830
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:26,920
audience on the view of the Russian

831
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:26,920
Russian view towards the future of

832
00:56:35,039 --> 00:56:40,240
and from this lecture you could very

833
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:43,280
easily understand that the problems of

834
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:49,200
the so-called Islamic terrorism do not

835
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:49,200
have any respect to the true quranic

836
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:56,880
Islam

837
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:07,400
nevertheless we all will witness huge

838
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:07,400
big problems in the next 20 30 years to

839
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:18,280
come those problems will arise from the

840
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:20,680
differences from huge differences

841
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:23,400
between the historic Islam as we see it

842
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:23,400
and quranic

843
00:57:23,799 --> 00:57:26,799
Islam

844
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:37,520
today my my lecture today I would like

845
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:39,400
to dedicate with your commission to the

846
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:41,960
issues of

847
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:44,799
globalization it's various views towards

848
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:48,960
globalization and some uh some

849
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:48,960
alternative view which is now in

850
00:57:53,799 --> 00:57:56,799
Russia

851
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:04,680
President Obama the US president

852
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:08,119
President Obama now has an advisor on

853
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:12,160
globalization his name is Barak Han and

854
00:58:08,119 --> 00:58:13,680
probably you have viewed his delivery of

855
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:16,680
American style

856
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:16,680
globalization

857
00:58:21,559 --> 00:58:27,359
recently this is exactly the last minute

858
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:29,240
understanding of the United States by

859
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:33,160
the United States establishment of the

860
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:33,160
globalization of the meanings of the

861
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:45,280
globalization and we had done a very

862
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:47,280
thorough study of what is there in the

863
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:49,559
minds of the American analytical think

864
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:53,720
tanks and I want to provide you to

865
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:56,720
present to you the alternative vision of

866
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:56,720
globalization

867
00:59:01,799 --> 00:59:08,079
and also my point is to give you to try

868
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:11,119
to give you the alternative uh thesises

869
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:13,440
the alternative ideas which are

870
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:16,240
absolutely closed to the understanding

871
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:16,240
of the American

872
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:27,599
mentality that is the meaning which

873
00:59:24,359 --> 00:59:30,359
stands behind the theme for our meeting

874
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:33,240
today which called which is called the

875
00:59:30,359 --> 00:59:35,920
Russian response to contemporary

876
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:35,920
challenges of

877
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:43,839
globalization first of all I would like

878
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:46,160
to say that in our understanding

879
00:59:43,839 --> 00:59:48,799
globalization is an objectively run

880
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,799
objective

881
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:58,880
process and several years ago our

882
00:59:56,079 --> 01:00:00,480
president Mr Vladimir Putin spoke on

883
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:03,000
this and confirmed that this is an

884
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:03,000
objective

885
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:13,000
process objective process in he implied

886
01:00:10,359 --> 01:00:15,359
that this is an objective process of

887
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:19,520
integration of the productive forces of

888
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:19,520
the humankind of the entire

889
01:00:23,559 --> 01:00:26,559
Humanity

890
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:31,839
but however it appears to be with

891
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:34,520
globalization being the objective

892
01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:37,280
process the concept of control of

893
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:40,039
globalization is purely subjective is

894
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:40,039
dependent to the

895
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:53,200
will that is why you can see that in

896
01:00:50,359 --> 01:00:55,960
some in someone's interests the tension

897
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:59,359
between globalists and anti-globalists

898
01:00:55,960 --> 01:01:03,280
is carefully caressed and and and made

899
01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:03,280
made public to everyone's

900
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:15,760
eye globalization didn't start in the

901
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:18,880
20th century or 21st century it exists

902
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:22,480
for long as as long as the world global

903
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:22,480
historical process

904
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:28,640
existed

905
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:30,799
we were able to look deep into the

906
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:34,720
history of this process for

907
01:01:30,799 --> 01:01:34,720
approximately 7,000 years

908
01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:45,760
back we are using the uh written

909
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:45,760
artifacts for analyzing this

910
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:52,319
verses the scripts of anient Egypt

911
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:56,440
Babylon

912
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:56,440
Assyria and other AR

913
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:09,039
so what is what is the true challenge of

914
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:12,079
the Contemporary globalization process

915
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:12,079
what is it how can

916
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:20,400
specify I will try to explain it to you

917
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:22,720
and present it over this scheme which

918
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,720
you can

919
01:02:23,359 --> 01:02:29,400
see

920
01:02:26,359 --> 01:02:31,680
imagine that you're living 3 or 4,000

921
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:31,680
years

922
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:42,640
ago you see the world technologically

923
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:42,640
almost unchanged and technologically

924
01:02:44,839 --> 01:02:49,640
unadvanced you can see the dozens or

925
01:02:47,559 --> 01:02:51,760
even hundreds of generations of

926
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:53,359
humankind lived through the period of

927
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:56,359
the same

928
01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:56,359
Technologies

929
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:05,400
years passed the GES pass and

930
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:07,680
generations passed but the world was

931
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:10,559
left absolutely Tech technically the

932
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:10,559
same as it used to

933
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:20,920
be while many of us present here in this

934
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:23,279
call live at the ends of the 20th

935
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:26,279
century and the beginning of the 21st

936
01:03:23,279 --> 01:03:26,279
Century

937
01:03:30,839 --> 01:03:36,000
and you can witness yourselves see for

938
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:38,480
your own with your own eyes that during

939
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:41,480
the life of one generation Technologies

940
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:41,480
has changed many

941
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:50,760
times in the main branches of social

942
01:03:48,599 --> 01:03:53,279
life technology has changed from five to

943
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:56,279
six times during the time period of one

944
01:03:53,279 --> 01:03:56,279
generation

945
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:05,599
what has happened what has uh what has

946
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:09,599
really happened in the middle of the

947
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:09,599
20th century let's look at

948
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:19,559
it I want you to pay your most attention

949
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:19,559
to this period of

950
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:28,079
time

951
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:30,640
time can be different you can speak of

952
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:32,760
historical time of social time of

953
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:37,240
biological

954
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:37,240
time or even astronomic

955
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:47,920
time everything is dependent on which

956
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:47,920
exact process you take as ealon

957
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:57,599
as

958
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:59,720
so here on this on this SCH you can see

959
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:03,839
the two processes green is the

960
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:03,839
biological fluctuation

961
01:05:04,039 --> 01:05:09,720
process its frequency is the same over

962
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:09,720
all the period of

963
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:15,680
time and you can see the social

964
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:18,680
fluctuation process with variable

965
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:18,680
fluctuation

966
01:05:23,079 --> 01:05:27,279
frequency

967
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:30,079
and actually we dis close discovered the

968
01:05:27,279 --> 01:05:33,200
fact that these two processes were never

969
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:33,200
being considered

970
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:43,760
together humankind is the information

971
01:05:39,359 --> 01:05:43,760
system comprised of the two levels as we

972
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:55,440
think generically you can you can see

973
01:05:52,119 --> 01:05:59,240
the information uh Innovation through

974
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:59,240
the impacts of the genetic

975
01:06:04,319 --> 01:06:10,039
codes on the social level we we see the

976
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:12,039
change of Technologies as the

977
01:06:10,039 --> 01:06:15,039
information change which goes through

978
01:06:12,039 --> 01:06:15,039
penetrates deeper the

979
01:06:21,319 --> 01:06:28,440
society that's why we can speak about

980
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:31,079
the rate or the pace of change of the

981
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:34,079
information situation both genetically

982
01:06:31,079 --> 01:06:37,000
and socially and you can see these two

983
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:37,000
lines on the

984
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:44,440
bottom so you can see that the rate of

985
01:06:42,319 --> 01:06:47,119
renewal of the information on genetic

986
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:47,119
level is the

987
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:54,039
same and you can see it's different on

988
01:06:50,799 --> 01:06:56,520
the social or out out the genetic level

989
01:06:54,039 --> 01:06:56,520
level of

990
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:06,119
information that definitely you canate

991
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:07,720
that sooner or later these rats will be

992
01:07:06,119 --> 01:07:10,920
meeting somewhere these two lines will

993
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:10,920
be meeting at one definite

994
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:18,160
point so we have gone through that

995
01:07:16,319 --> 01:07:19,920
period we now past that period it has

996
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:22,160
been a very dangerous period for the

997
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:22,160
whole

998
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:25,920
humankind

999
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:33,000
and this period of time actually was

1000
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:35,520
during the middle U Middle years of the

1001
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,520
20th

1002
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:42,880
century during that period of time the

1003
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:42,880
world has witnessed two

1004
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:52,920
world that was the period of huge Global

1005
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:55,920
political arrest and social

1006
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:55,920
revolutions

1007
01:07:56,400 --> 01:08:01,640
by the end of that period world has

1008
01:07:58,279 --> 01:08:01,640
witnessed Atomic nuclear

1009
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:11,359
weapons which actually which actually

1010
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:14,000
put an end to the accessibility or

1011
01:08:11,359 --> 01:08:17,000
usability of world wars which we had

1012
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,000
witnessed in 20th

1013
01:08:22,839 --> 01:08:29,440
century time basically in scientific

1014
01:08:26,839 --> 01:08:32,159
terms we're speaking of the fact that

1015
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:34,080
the new the change of the ethalon

1016
01:08:32,159 --> 01:08:37,239
fluctuation rates of Social and

1017
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:37,239
biological time has

1018
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:47,080
occurred which finalized which was

1019
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:47,080
finalized by the end of the 20th

1020
01:08:51,199 --> 01:08:56,600
century so basically the world The World

1021
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:59,400
At Large and we together we are living

1022
01:08:56,600 --> 01:09:01,719
in a totally different Epoch a totally

1023
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:01,719
different

1024
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:11,400
time the ancient priests knew about the

1025
01:09:09,239 --> 01:09:13,920
such a period of time in the human

1026
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:16,799
history and they called that apocalypsis

1027
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:16,799
as a Biblical

1028
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:26,880
ter

1029
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:28,960
so what does it mean what does this

1030
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:31,520
comparison of the rates mean what

1031
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:31,520
traditions

1032
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:43,440
mean it appeared that these lines are

1033
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:46,799
determining the social behavior

1034
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:46,799
Logic on the

1035
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:56,640
whole this is also an objective event

1036
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:58,320
and it doesn't really matter only in

1037
01:09:56,640 --> 01:10:01,080
Russia but it is definitely going

1038
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:01,080
throughout the whole

1039
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:08,679
world so before the middle of the 20th

1040
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:08,679
century we had one logic of social

1041
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:13,480
behavior we've seen that

1042
01:10:16,199 --> 01:10:21,120
logic starting from the middle of the

1043
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:22,640
20th century there was totally different

1044
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:25,640
logic of social

1045
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:27,800
behavior

1046
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:30,400
to my deep regret all the leaders of all

1047
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:34,560
the world of all the

1048
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:34,560
countries do not know about

1049
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:42,080
that but you can definitely feel it or

1050
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:44,040
perceive it through a visible

1051
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:47,480
catastrophic events which are going on

1052
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:47,480
or spreading throughout the whole

1053
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:52,640
world the number of catastrophic events

1054
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:55,640
is

1055
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:55,640
growing

1056
01:10:59,159 --> 01:11:03,679
one of the main reasons for that is that

1057
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:06,080
the society is not adequate adequately

1058
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:07,880
deceiving this historical change which

1059
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:10,560
has occurred in the social norms of

1060
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:10,560
behavior of

1061
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:17,400
humanity so what is the main essence of

1062
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:17,400
such a dramatic

1063
01:11:18,199 --> 01:11:25,560
change you will easily understand

1064
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:25,560
that

1065
01:11:29,719 --> 01:11:34,520
if someone from you before the middle of

1066
01:11:32,159 --> 01:11:39,040
the 20th centuries would receive some

1067
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:39,040
education get educated at that

1068
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:47,880
times that that education would be that

1069
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:50,360
knowledge you received would be enough

1070
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:52,560
and sufficient not only for your life

1071
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:55,560
but for your life of your children and

1072
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:55,560
grandchildren

1073
01:11:57,040 --> 01:12:01,000
what really mattered at those times was

1074
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:04,080
the factology the number of facts which

1075
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,080
you can operate and

1076
01:12:05,719 --> 01:12:10,320
proceed starting from the middle of the

1077
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:10,320
20th

1078
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:24,600
century there is no more stable

1079
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:28,280
factology factology is becoming obs lead

1080
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:32,239
NE within five or six years so you have

1081
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:32,239
to revew your

1082
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:44,840
knowledge and what will be determining

1083
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:48,880
the future of humanity is ability to go

1084
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:51,560
to methodology of new knowledge of

1085
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:51,560
getting new

1086
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:55,440
knowledge

1087
01:12:55,840 --> 01:13:02,000
this event which I have just told about

1088
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:02,000
was open this is closed in

1089
01:13:06,199 --> 01:13:12,040
Russia definitely we have to go further

1090
01:13:08,639 --> 01:13:15,159
and we made uh made some delivery some

1091
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:18,760
research work inside the methodology of

1092
01:13:15,159 --> 01:13:18,760
getting new adequate

1093
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:28,199
knowledge this me ology is called in

1094
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:31,920
Russia the adequate adequately uh

1095
01:13:28,199 --> 01:13:31,920
complete theory of

1096
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:47,760
control inside this adequately complete

1097
01:13:43,639 --> 01:13:50,440
uh uh control theory the core thing is

1098
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:55,120
the

1099
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:57,920
control uh control fun function complete

1100
01:13:55,120 --> 01:14:00,800
function of control

1101
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:03,159
cff so and you can understand that CF

1102
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:05,560
describes circulation of Information

1103
01:14:03,159 --> 01:14:09,480
Society and control starting from the

1104
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:09,480
setting Vector of goals to completion of

1105
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:17,760
control so it can be splitted into seven

1106
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:17,760
stages of

1107
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:26,040
control even if you look at the events

1108
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:28,159
of your life of your everyday life you

1109
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:31,600
will definitely see each one of these

1110
01:14:28,159 --> 01:14:31,600
seven uh seven

1111
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:39,480
points they are there when you're using

1112
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:42,560
selfcontrol when you're using

1113
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:42,560
controlling your own

1114
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:52,920
psychology these uh seven seven

1115
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:55,080
principles can also be applied to any uh

1116
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:57,719
object control like the society itself

1117
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:57,719
of the world

1118
01:15:05,719 --> 01:15:12,840
L each time when your intellect meets

1119
01:15:09,639 --> 01:15:14,840
something new it it uh it really is

1120
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:18,639
under the pressure of getting

1121
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:18,639
understanding this what is new what is

1122
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:24,760
there how can you even know what is new

1123
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:26,320
whether this is new to your mentality

1124
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:29,000
and to your knowledge or this is an old

1125
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:31,280
thing how can you tell what is new or

1126
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,280
what is

1127
01:15:32,639 --> 01:15:37,360
old you're just your your brain your

1128
01:15:35,239 --> 01:15:41,360
mentality is just solving the task of

1129
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:41,360
whether this is it or this is not

1130
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:50,639
it and definitely at this point your new

1131
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:52,520
knowledge is not there embedded into the

1132
01:15:50,639 --> 01:15:55,199
into the system of your stereotypes

1133
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:55,199
which you have

1134
01:16:04,679 --> 01:16:10,840
so each individual intellect creates

1135
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:13,360
huge work elaborates hardly over trying

1136
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:15,199
to identify what kind of this what kind

1137
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:18,800
of stereotypes could be appli to this

1138
01:16:15,199 --> 01:16:18,800
novel which you're which

1139
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:25,120
are

1140
01:16:28,199 --> 01:16:33,040
I could definitely deliver a very well a

1141
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:34,719
big lecture regarding each of the

1142
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:36,760
individual stages of the Control

1143
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:40,120
Function but because of lack of time I

1144
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:40,120
will just say few words

1145
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:51,760
this then if you have identified this

1146
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:54,040
new information new factor and you have

1147
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:56,320
put it into into the framework of your

1148
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:59,239
stereotypes then the next stage is you

1149
01:16:56,320 --> 01:17:00,960
will definitely go and ask yourself what

1150
01:16:59,239 --> 01:17:03,320
is the purpose what I want to do with

1151
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:06,800
that what is the target of what are my

1152
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:06,800
goals about this new

1153
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:19,440
situation so the fourth stage which you

1154
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:21,000
definitely follow but you never think

1155
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:23,280
about this this is done almost

1156
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:25,520
automatically for you by your intellect

1157
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:28,719
is that you are forming concept of

1158
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:28,719
control over this new

1159
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:34,760
situation the other things are

1160
01:17:33,199 --> 01:17:36,560
absolutely easily understandable so

1161
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:38,760
you're making a structure or you're

1162
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:40,880
making a vehicle which will bring you to

1163
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:40,880
the

1164
01:17:42,639 --> 01:17:46,880
goal then you supervise whether the

1165
01:17:45,239 --> 01:17:48,520
structure is operating properly whether

1166
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:51,080
it the structure is really instrumental

1167
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:51,080
to meet your

1168
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:57,400
needs

1169
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:59,280
and then at stage seven if the structure

1170
01:17:57,400 --> 01:18:01,440
has completed the goal which you have

1171
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:04,600
identified then you just liquidate the

1172
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:04,600
structure or reform the

1173
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:09,639
structure but I would like to ask you
