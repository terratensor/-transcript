0:04
yes uh good day good morning dear
0:12
colleagues first of all I would like to wholeheartedly thank the management and
0:18
top officials of usim and
0:28
uh University for this wonderful opportunity to deliver a speech at this
0:34
wonderful best
0:50
university I would like to represent to you the Contemporary Russian Outlook insight into the challenges of
0:58
globalization
1:07
for Barak probably you have heard about the Contemporary the nowadays the present
1:13
day advisor to President Barack Obama on geopolitical issues Mr
1:25
barana he is representing the American Outlook into the globalization challenges
1:41
problem but his uh ideas regarding the globalization and the challenges of
1:47
viations are according to our view are
1:55
inadequate so actually I will deliver a lecture regarding this issue I will try try to develop all
2:09
this in our view globalization is an objective process meaning that
2:14
globalization is the concentration of the productive forces of
2:25
humanity we understand that humanity is single kind is Unified kind and a sing
2:38
Spirit basically we understand that globalization process as a mean as a as
2:45
a as as it is uh related to the concentration of the productive forces
2:50
of the entire human kind is an objective process and the president of the Russian Federation used to be speaking all
2:58
this but the control over this process is
3:06
subjective is dependent on the
3:14
will so what is the current Global challenge to the entire humankind the
3:19
present
3:28
day we will start with a very important issue in this regard is we will have to
3:35
look at the way the change of social behavior logic took place in the middle
3:41
of the 20th
3:48
century the whole humankind in information wise is the two level
3:58
system so the information Exchange in the
4:04
humankind in the society has two levels the one level is that information is
4:09
changed at genetical level genetic
4:15
level as you can see it on the screen so the genetic uh the genetic information
4:22
change is stable over time it changes the change of this uh of this process is
4:28
the change of the generation
4:40
we have analyzed the written history of humankind and we assess this written
4:45
history of humankind uh as deep as 7,000 years
4:54
ago we understand that each time the generation changes one time in 25 years
5:05
approximately and that should not be new to you that the first generation is delivering new
5:15
ideas the second generation is striving to implement these ideas to bring them
5:20
into life the third generation keeps the
5:27
inertia of that press and the fourth generation overthrows
5:34
what has been
5:40
done but the society is informatively changed all also on the social level as
5:52
well and the main thing which brings uh
5:57
uh brings clue to the process of social renovation are the
6:09
Technologies if you have a deep inside the historical background say at 5,000
6:15
years ago then you could
6:24
notice that the world has been unchanged for many many many Generations over the
6:30
last thousand
6:38
years which means that technologically the main uh social and the main
6:43
technological branches of the life of
6:49
society uh during the life of the same technologist hundreds or tens and
6:55
hundreds of generations went through the same technological envir
7:13
enironment we now live in the 21st century and it is absolutely common knowledge to us living in the 21st
7:19
century that Technologies change many form many times over this the lifetime
7:25
of one generation but
7:34
if you put these two processes the biological time and the so-called social time in
7:44
comparison you can see is this as the lines for rate of information change in
7:50
the
7:57
society green line is the stable line of change of information on genetical level
8:04
of
8:11
humankind the information change on social level is
8:28
variable if this is objectively so so then the two lines the green line which is
8:35
Constantine and the red line which is rival going up they should meet at one certain
8:45
point and we were much interested in the period when these two lines overlapped
8:50
with each other so you can see that the yellow uh
8:56
the yellow part of of the scene is is is exactly marking the period when
9:03
the two uh when the two lines glided when they got into
9:11
related and tell you exactly that that period of time was very dangerous period
9:16
of time for the entire
9:25
humankind during that time marked as yellow the two World Wars occurred on
9:33
planet
9:39
Earth the the first world war started in
9:44
1914 and the second world war started in
9:54
1939 that was exactly the period when the frequency of the two processes were
10:08
equal and also as you may remember at that period of time the whole globe the
10:14
whole planet was covered by a wave of
10:26
revolutions revolutions were not only in Russia but took place in China in Mexico
10:31
India elsewhere so and it all ended by the end of the
10:43
50s by the end of that period human kind delivered an atomic
10:57
bomb the appearance of the nuclear weapons and effective uh use of nuclear
11:03
weapons as you know from history displayed to all the humanity impossibility of waging big Wars with
11:10
with the nuclear
11:19
weapons so exactly that period which is marked with yellow here on the screen was named by us the period of the change
11:27
of social behavior
11:38
logic that's because if we look into the period which which is before this period
11:44
marked as
11:56
yellow we notice one very important thing that a man living before that period if that man would acquire some
12:04
knowledge could be absolutely confident that this knowledge will be enough for
12:09
his lifetime and even for the lifetime of his sons daughters and grandsons and
12:18
granddaughters that was the period of the predominance and acquiring of factal
12:27
knowledge
12:32
and now after that yellow line we we understand that it is now the third
12:38
generation entering life in the New Logic of social
12:54
behavior and even the students of today they absolutely easily understand that
13:00
the factology facts which they are receiving during the course of Education
13:06
become sometimes become obsolete when they end this
13:17
education that is why we are sure that the new determining factor for the
13:23
education of the next generation of this generation is the methodological educ
13:29
it is the predominant
13:36
factor in different countries people who do not see this problem who do not understand this problem try to solve
13:43
that in different
13:51
ways say in the United States of America they try to make the period of Education
13:56
more extensive same about
14:06
Russia and uh say education the secondary education in Russia has reached 12
14:17
years but it is interesting to note that if the school boys and school girls are given the methodological grounds for
14:24
acquiring new knowledge
14:30
then the process of such education without losing any quality of
14:36
it can be minimized to say seven or eight
14:49
years apart from that what I have told you you may notice the growing
14:54
catastrophic events all over Earth
15:03
the number of social catastrophes and the number of technogen genetic
15:08
catastroph is growing
15:17
rapidly we also see it as the the fact that that people do not understand that
15:25
the change of social behavior logic has already
15:33
occurred so what is the the global Society what is the Contemporary Society
15:41
currently we called that Society the mob Elite
15:55
Society we have a definition for the mob mob is a crowd of of people who live
16:03
according to the writings and analyze things according to some
16:15
authorities according to the uh to the to the authorities of the leaders
16:20
according to the authorities of the sacred writings according to authority of any other uh Authority in the society
16:28
or texts which can be uh which can be even uh distorted or
16:41
misunderstood and we understand that this mob Elite Society in the current
16:46
New Logic of social behavior is not I cannot leave out it will
16:57
perish and we understand that in order to to
17:03
turn this mob into people we have to change or dramatically change the
17:15
culture so basically this is the key point for the investigation for the
17:21
studies which is being done by a group of scientists which I'm now here
17:27
representing how what we should do in order to facilitate that mob becomes
17:41
people so I'm now going to briefly deliver to you some latest studies the
17:47
results of these studies we have identified the so-called
17:55
complete function of control of the social behavior a control full function
18:03
cff please pay attention to these
18:12
schemes we have identified seven stages of the complete of the full Control
18:24
Function they do objectively exist whenever a a person wants to take his
18:32
own mentality under
18:40
control it is definitely applicable to the control of the social groups
18:45
starting with say business starting with production
18:57
yes even if you look carefully at yourself at your motivations and behavior you
19:03
will see that all these seven functions are present all the seven factors are
19:20
present at uh stage one of this process you identify the new factor which is
19:27
affecting your en
19:34
enironment so at this very exact moment you are solving a task to identify
19:40
whether this is new or not new to
19:53
you uh the Holy Quran has uh Surah 25 which is called Alan which is in Russian
20:00
called the uh uh the determination the
20:10
telling we understand that God Allah gives this determining the uh ability to
20:16
tell things according to the Consciousness and according to the heart
20:27
condition and you may already notice that for some people the new knowledge
20:33
is not existent and others would immediately
20:39
identify ah this is new this is new
20:46
knowledge on the second stage of the control full
20:56
function you are trying to the new knowledge into the system of
21:01
your stereotypes into the system of your mental stereotypes which you already
21:08
have this is the most difficult task for
21:14
you you will have to look into your old existing
21:21
stereotypes and somehow position this new Factor new information into the
21:27
system system of
21:33
stereotypes once you have identified this new factor and you paid attention to
21:39
it then you definitely need that for
21:46
something so then you start to create your own Vector of
21:53
goals in regards to this new Factor
22:00
basically the vector of goals is a list of your wishes in some decent
22:11
order on the first uh place in your vector of goals you put your goal your
22:17
aim which is the last uh to get rid of if need
22:26
be and the last place is occupied by a goal
22:33
which you can easily get rid of when you solve some other
22:41
problems so each of the humans living on Earth does do does possess some certain
22:52
goals what do you do is you Ed your newly identified vector of goals
22:58
regarding new information have received into your existing Vector of
23:07
goals probably you will have to overlook and oversee and change the hierarchy of
23:13
the goals in your vector of
23:20
goals and on the fourth stage you create a con concept for reaching these goals
23:33
the fifth stage is more understandable to use so you create a structure or a
23:38
purpose vehicle in order to reach these
23:45
goals and Stage six you're just viewing and contr and uh supervising your
23:51
vehicle which you have created specially to reach that
23:56
goals
24:03
then at stage seven you either continue to maintain these vehicles or you
24:08
liquidate these vehicles as needless or if you have reached the
24:15
goals which you have set in front of you so basically these are the seven
24:22
stages of full Control Function they are all always
24:33
present if anyone of the stages is missing is missing regarding your
24:39
information which you are putting into that stage then it is someone else who is
24:45
doing that for you but then it's not you who
24:52
control who control yourself and and controls that processes
25:00
which you want to to keep under your
25:15
control but control F function is always present but you can definitely deliver
25:22
more detailed uh picture of each of the stages
25:29
so I would like to ask you one single question I would like to address to all of
25:46
you can you tell me now the president the king or the General Secretary of any
25:53
country who is controlling the first four stages of the complete
25:58
Control Function that is not done by the
26:06
president of the United States that is not done by the president
26:12
of Russia that is not done by no
26:21
one although there should be someone who controls the first four stages of the
26:27
complete Control
26:33
Function that is why next point is very important we have to talk about the
26:39
kinds of power in the
26:47
social we understand that power is the
26:52
realized the implemented capability to control
27:03
for you it is very common to understand that there are three kinds of
27:09
Power the legislative power the executive
27:16
power and judicial power these are common things and you
27:23
know uh something which is known everywhere in the world
27:30
World in reality however there are not three but five kinds of
27:38
Power which work all together and there is in reality there
27:45
is no division of powers they work all as
27:56
one as you remember at stage four of this e you have to create your own concept of
28:09
control so those who control the first four stages of the complete Control
28:16
Function exist but it is not common knowledge
28:23
that it is not really uh something which is widely discussed you
28:30
and the point is not that this kind of power is hidden away from everybody's
28:40
eye you might know that if some process of some event
28:47
exists and there is an image in the Society of such a process or such an
28:56
event but if you do not have the adequate naming for such an event or
29:02
such a process then this process of this event
29:09
is sort of not
29:16
existent that's exactly what is happening now to that kind of power which we called the conceptual
29:26
power Global predictor we called that conceptual power related to Earth as a
29:33
whole the global predictor control means
29:45
prediction and we we know that Napoleon was the first politician to put that
29:50
into these exact
29:56
words when now President Putin was asked once
30:03
what gift he would like to have he said I would like to have the gift of
30:13
prediction So This Global conceptual
30:18
power was formed according to our ideas in ancient
30:26
Egypt approximately from 4 to 5,000 years
30:32
before Christ and once having emerged it didn't
30:39
go anywhere it did not
30:45
vanish conceptual power are the ideas and
30:53
people who are bearing these ideas or who are capable to adjust these ideas
30:59
with
31:04
time ancient Egypt was met was controlled by the 22
31:12
heropants herant translated from the Greek language are the people who know
31:22
tomorrow they split it into two teams of 11 11 in the north and 11 in the south
31:28
of the country it was them who created the
31:41
procedure the procedure which would as a result of which we would receive
31:47
unanimity and a consens consens regarding various
31:53
issues and not only just by voting like it is accepted in all the de
31:59
democracies of the
32:07
world through the use of the same methodology for the search of Truth which they
32:15
possessed you may ask me why ancient
32:26
Egypt you know that 5,000 years ago only Egypt
32:33
was possessing the uh the historically uh stable written
32:42
Culture by analyzing these written
32:47
artifacts which refer to the times of the Jer
32:52
far it's approximately 3,000 years
33:04
at those time analyzing the situation they have managed to see the first stage
33:11
of the complete function of control they have identified the new thing which is
33:16
the which is now called
33:22
globalization they were managed they managed to understand the globalization is an objective
33:32
process and the control of the globalization is subjective
33:42
process they were the first to uh to go through the first four stages of the complete control
33:51
function and they have elaborated and brought about uh the global concept of
33:59
control which you know all of you and everyone of you and this is the
34:12
Bible the Bible is definitely not a product of mentality of a nedic tribe
34:19
called Jews Bible is a very serious book in
34:25
this regard
34:32
this the biblical concept or the concept of the Bible dominates now throughout
34:37
the whole world culture is always uh determined by
34:45
the
34:51
concept in order to understand the concept you will have to analyze and study the culture in which you are
35:01
living that is exactly the point where we we have studed our
35:11
research we started to make deep research of the culture of the X
35:18
USSR Western Europe and the United States of
35:25
America this culture is displayed widely in museums in music in
35:36
architecture there are definitely other cultures like the culture of Islam theist
35:43
orist huist culture but it is the
35:49
Bible which dominates in the
35:55
society and therefore the Western culture is aggressively pushing straight forward
36:02
throughout the whole world I visited India once and I
36:09
delivering a lecture in
36:20
India I heard I heard an objection from one of the leaders and he said that look over the last 200 years there are no
36:27
more symbols of any Western culture left in India
36:32
nothing and then I raised a computer and cell mobile phone I show them the
36:47
Automobiles and I told him that you know sometimes things speak on a certain language with with
36:54
people and this language is also also Bor by the biblical
37:02
culture this biblical culture gave birth to the technosphere which we are now
37:13
using and whatever we do in order to defend our
37:19
culture you all
37:25
know you all know that the main cultural
37:32
center of the western biblical civilization which is called the Hollywood it is penetrating all all
37:39
parts of the
37:44
world may ask why the biblical culture of the West has become to dominate in the
37:55
society
38:00
my answer is that only in the Bible you can feel you can see the exact exactly
38:06
set and straightforwardly put sociological
38:20
Doctrine it sounds like that that and he is using now the the citing the Bible he
38:26
says that you should not give your brother silver
38:32
bread or any silver or bread or any other things
38:39
that you can give to other nations in usually ideas if you give that to us in in in
38:47
terms of usury to other peoples then you will re all over the other
38:53
peoples and those peoples who will not be who would not like to be your
38:59
servants they will be
39:05
perished from our Viewpoint this is direct aggression towards the whole the entire
39:13
humankind and Quran was uh given to
39:21
Muhammad in order to stop that conceptual aggression in the world
39:31
we think that there were three
39:41
Revelations first revelation was given on the very upside of the mop Elite
39:47
pyramid to the
39:53
pH to the 10th Faron of the 18th Dynasty 13th century before
40:03
Christ that far broke all ties with the
40:08
uh withan of
40:13
am and he was the first to raise the issue of one single
40:21
God and he was putting this into these verses of the him and of
40:35
Aton but the uh the priest hierarchy put this undercover put this Anem
40:44
undercover and the world knew about learned about this Anon only at the end
40:50
of 19th century next Revelation was given to is
40:57
to to to the
41:03
Christ knew he was literate man he knew writing he he could
41:10
read but he didn't not put the Revelation on
41:16
paper so he went to the people with just verbal
41:25
prophesies he definitely knew that his teaching will be uh further uh perverted
41:38
by Third Revelation was given to
41:47
Muhammad in Russia we have many people who study all the three
41:55
Revelations we have compared the of Aton which is
42:02
13th century BC the contents of Quran which is
42:08
seventh century these two Revelations are
42:14
divided by 2,000
42:20
years we have applied some computer Technologies in order to make comparative assessment of what what is
42:26
exactly the contents about when we have done that we were
42:33
amazed and astonished not only by the uh Unity of the
42:40
contents but also the text and the the frequency and the rhythmic of these
42:51
Revelations uh we call it the white poetry so it's uh in Russian it's called
42:57
White poet we have the white poetic effect present in both these
43:10
Revelations and the fact which we see now is the standoff between the world of Islam and the world of
43:24
Bible is the result that in Quran you have an absolutely fixed right
43:29
definition of usury and this is an absolutely directly
43:37
fixed negative approach to
43:45
usury from that I should say that there is quranic quranic
43:52
Islam and we understand that it is the historic Ally set
44:00
Islam find difference between quranic Islam and historically set
44:09
Islam the point is that Muslims all over the world cannot
44:15
unite and divided themselves into shs and
44:20
sunnit there is no saying in Quran about that
44:29
similar similar thing absolutely similar thing is with
44:35
Christianity the historically set Christianity and the teaching of Isa the
44:43
teaching of Christ are far far far away from each
44:48
other was long away from I'm sorry to make this uh hisorical
44:56
backgrounds delivering to
45:03
you but I am convinced that I'm talking to the high level of
45:08
audience and I would like you to
45:17
understand in Russia there is definitely some some understanding of the religious
45:24
uh faiths and religious uh beliefs by far more more
45:35
advanced the historically said religion the the teachings themselves are
45:41
different in a ways similar
45:47
to similar to the fact how they decorate an icon in Russia from the icon itself
45:53
so make they make these gold decorations covering almost all kinds of icons and that the icon itself is not visible
46:04
sometimes we uh we actually uh make difference between trust to God and
46:12
trust in
46:17
God and this is sort of uh giving you guidance further how trust in God
46:23
differs from trust to God
46:31
so the whole humankind is now on the
46:37
edge of overcoming the real
46:42
atheism and we have atheism of the two times as we
46:47
see the soal idealistic atheism and materialistic atheism
47:00
in Russia over 1,000 years we have been overcoming the idealistic
47:08
atheism idealistic atheism of all the churches named after
47:17
Christ also in Russia we had three generations of overcoming the materialist atheism of
47:24
marxist
47:31
basically the point of Russia is that Russia in some in this regard is by far
47:36
and more advanced than other countries they have experienced a
47:44
lot to put it in plain terms the the idealistic atheists say God exists but
47:52
they they make some presumptions about God which is is not inherent to God and
47:57
that's why they they atheists sometimes in Russia they will
48:03
say that God is is a grandfather with a beard or something like
48:09
that that Jesus Christ is the Son of God although Quran speaks absolutely
48:17
right on this point that God Allah doesn't have no children no
48:24
helpers
48:33
materialists material atheists are absolutely simple they say okay there is no God at
48:40
all when you ask this material atheist what is exist in there they would said
48:46
okay nature exists and some laws exists and basically what they do they
48:53
make they give the tra of God to the God's
49:01
creation Quran says this that presumption does not cannot deprive you from the
49:11
truth I'm getting back to the to to my lecture
49:19
again those who represent this conceptual power know that in very great
49:24
detail
49:31
is they make the collision between the two different types of this atheism they
49:38
use they make these collisions between the the many times of
49:52
atheism so basically the Islamic Terror is the result of such collisions because
49:58
it's different understanding of the true Islamic and quranic Islam and the
50:11
historical this is also an aggression against Islam so the so-called Islamic
50:16
terrorism is a sort of biblical aggression towards so there are five kinds of
50:24
Power you already know something about the
50:31
true nature of the conceptual
50:41
power its main uh tra of character is that this kind of power is autocreated
50:47
by its nature and it disregards all Democratic
50:53
procedures you cannot be elected to the conceptual
51:00
power you cannot definitely pay the bill and get elected to the
51:08
conceptual and you cannot be there by a recommendation of some high level
51:24
authorities it's uh actually one point is that the
51:30
current mop Elite Society is run under the formula that each individual Works
51:36
to the measure of understanding things for himself and for the measure of non understanding things he works for
51:42
someone who understands more so basically the true thing is that you can be there in the conceptual Power by the
51:50
measure of your understanding of things
52:00
so conceptual power is the highest intas Social Power which is their
52:09
existent conceptual power affects uh superstate
52:21
control according to the formula which was once mentioned by plutar who said
52:27
that you control but you as well being
52:36
controlled conceptual power brings about the concept for the whole
52:54
man even when this concept is anti-human by its nature and they have to think how to
53:01
put this concept into acceptable terms for the public mentality then they would need some ideologies to wrap this
53:08
concept into applicable terminology so the second
53:13
kind of power is ideological power and then we come down to the kinds
53:20
of Power which we all already know is legislative number three
53:27
what they do is basically based on the concept they based on the concept and
53:33
based on the current ideology they create
53:44
laws and then comes executive or administrative power and executive power
53:49
implements these laws by the use of various uh leverages they they
53:57
us and finally we come down to judicial
54:04
power which its main goal is to defend the ruling the dominating concept
54:10
against interference of other
54:20
Concepts I would like to say that in Russia currently nowadays we have we have the alternative concept to the
54:28
existing biblical
54:35
concept it is uncovers and unveils all the necessary information and
54:46
knowledge we called that ladies and gentlemen can you please put your hand together and welcome
54:54
professorin
55:12
first of all I would like to thank esteemed
55:20
Mr for making such wonderful meeting and meeting you
55:34
that is true four months ago we had very very important and very informative meeting with
55:44
Mr it considered the current situation of the Islam Islam
55:54
world we also spoke about the differences between the historical Islam and the
56:00
real true quranic
56:09
Islam I could definitely deliver a very extended speech or lecture in this
56:15
regard to theed audience on the view of the Russian
56:22
Russian view towards the future of
56:35
and from this lecture you could very easily understand that the problems of
56:40
the so-called Islamic terrorism do not have any respect to the true quranic
56:53
Islam nevertheless we all will witness huge
57:01
big problems in the next 20 30 years to
57:12
come those problems will arise from the differences from huge differences
57:18
between the historic Islam as we see it and quranic
57:23
Islam
57:33
today my my lecture today I would like to dedicate with your commission to the issues of
57:39
globalization it's various views towards globalization and some uh some
57:44
alternative view which is now in
57:53
Russia
58:00
President Obama the US president President Obama now has an advisor on globalization his name is Barak Han and
58:08
probably you have viewed his delivery of American style
58:13
globalization
58:21
recently this is exactly the last minute understanding of the United States by
58:27
the United States establishment of the globalization of the meanings of the
58:40
globalization and we had done a very thorough study of what is there in the minds of the American analytical think
58:47
tanks and I want to provide you to present to you the alternative vision of
58:53
globalization
59:01
and also my point is to give you to try to give you the alternative uh thesises
59:08
the alternative ideas which are absolutely closed to the understanding
59:13
of the American
59:21
mentality that is the meaning which stands behind the theme for our meeting
59:27
today which called which is called the Russian response to contemporary
59:33
challenges of
59:40
globalization first of all I would like to say that in our understanding globalization is an objectively run
59:46
objective
59:53
process and several years ago our president Mr Vladimir Putin spoke on
59:58
this and confirmed that this is an objective
1:00:06
process objective process in he implied that this is an objective process of
1:00:13
integration of the productive forces of the humankind of the entire
1:00:23
Humanity but however it appears to be with
1:00:30
globalization being the objective process the concept of control of globalization is purely subjective is
1:00:37
dependent to the
1:00:46
will that is why you can see that in some in someone's interests the tension
1:00:53
between globalists and anti-globalists is carefully caressed and and and made
1:00:59
made public to everyone's
1:01:09
eye globalization didn't start in the 20th century or 21st century it exists
1:01:15
for long as as long as the world global historical process
1:01:23
existed we were able to look deep into the
1:01:28
history of this process for approximately 7,000 years
1:01:37
back we are using the uh written artifacts for analyzing this
1:01:47
verses the scripts of anient Egypt Babylon Assyria and other AR
1:02:03
so what is what is the true challenge of the Contemporary globalization process
1:02:09
what is it how can
1:02:16
specify I will try to explain it to you and present it over this scheme which you can
1:02:23
see imagine that you're living 3 or 4,000
1:02:29
years
1:02:35
ago you see the world technologically almost unchanged and technologically
1:02:44
unadvanced you can see the dozens or even hundreds of generations of humankind lived through the period of
1:02:51
the same Technologies
1:03:01
years passed the GES pass and generations passed but the world was left absolutely Tech technically the
1:03:07
same as it used to
1:03:16
be while many of us present here in this call live at the ends of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st
1:03:23
Century
1:03:30
and you can witness yourselves see for your own with your own eyes that during
1:03:36
the life of one generation Technologies has changed many
1:03:45
times in the main branches of social life technology has changed from five to
1:03:50
six times during the time period of one generation
1:04:01
what has happened what has uh what has really happened in the middle of the 20th century let's look at
1:04:12
it I want you to pay your most attention to this period of
1:04:23
time time can be different you can speak of historical time of social time of
1:04:30
biological time or even astronomic
1:04:39
time everything is dependent on which exact process you take as ealon
1:04:53
as so here on this on this SCH you can see the two processes green is the
1:04:59
biological fluctuation process its frequency is the same over
1:05:06
all the period of time and you can see the social
1:05:13
fluctuation process with variable fluctuation
1:05:23
frequency and actually we dis close discovered the fact that these two processes were never
1:05:30
being considered
1:05:36
together humankind is the information system comprised of the two levels as we
1:05:49
think generically you can you can see the information uh Innovation through
1:05:55
the impacts of the genetic
1:06:04
codes on the social level we we see the change of Technologies as the
1:06:10
information change which goes through penetrates deeper the
1:06:21
society that's why we can speak about the rate or the pace of change of the
1:06:28
information situation both genetically and socially and you can see these two
1:06:34
lines on the
1:06:39
bottom so you can see that the rate of renewal of the information on genetic level is the
1:06:48
same and you can see it's different on the social or out out the genetic level
1:06:54
level of
1:07:01
information that definitely you canate that sooner or later these rats will be meeting somewhere these two lines will
1:07:07
be meeting at one definite
1:07:13
point so we have gone through that period we now past that period it has been a very dangerous period for the
1:07:19
whole humankind
1:07:26
and this period of time actually was during the middle U Middle years of the
1:07:33
20th century during that period of time the
1:07:39
world has witnessed two
1:07:46
world that was the period of huge Global political arrest and social
1:07:52
revolutions by the end of that period world has
1:07:58
witnessed Atomic nuclear
1:08:05
weapons which actually which actually put an end to the accessibility or
1:08:11
usability of world wars which we had witnessed in 20th
1:08:22
century time basically in scientific terms we're speaking of the fact that
1:08:29
the new the change of the ethalon fluctuation rates of Social and biological time has
1:08:40
occurred which finalized which was finalized by the end of the 20th
1:08:51
century so basically the world The World At Large and we together we are living
1:08:56
in a totally different Epoch a totally different
1:09:05
time the ancient priests knew about the such a period of time in the human
1:09:11
history and they called that apocalypsis as a Biblical
1:09:22
ter so what does it mean what does this comparison of the rates mean what
1:09:28
traditions
1:09:35
mean it appeared that these lines are determining the social behavior
1:09:43
Logic on the
1:09:51
whole this is also an objective event and it doesn't really matter only in
1:09:56
Russia but it is definitely going throughout the whole
1:10:01
world so before the middle of the 20th century we had one logic of social
1:10:09
behavior we've seen that
1:10:16
logic starting from the middle of the 20th century there was totally different logic of social
1:10:22
behavior to my deep regret all the leaders of all
1:10:27
the world of all the countries do not know about
1:10:37
that but you can definitely feel it or perceive it through a visible catastrophic events which are going on
1:10:44
or spreading throughout the whole world the number of catastrophic events
1:10:50
is growing
1:10:59
one of the main reasons for that is that the society is not adequate adequately deceiving this historical change which
1:11:06
has occurred in the social norms of behavior of
1:11:11
humanity so what is the main essence of such a dramatic
1:11:18
change you will easily understand that
1:11:29
if someone from you before the middle of the 20th centuries would receive some education get educated at that
1:11:43
times that that education would be that knowledge you received would be enough and sufficient not only for your life
1:11:50
but for your life of your children and grandchildren
1:11:57
what really mattered at those times was the factology the number of facts which you can operate and
1:12:05
proceed starting from the middle of the 20th
1:12:18
century there is no more stable factology factology is becoming obs lead
1:12:24
NE within five or six years so you have to revew your
1:12:38
knowledge and what will be determining the future of humanity is ability to go
1:12:44
to methodology of new knowledge of getting new
1:12:52
knowledge this event which I have just told about
1:12:58
was open this is closed in
1:13:06
Russia definitely we have to go further and we made uh made some delivery some
1:13:12
research work inside the methodology of getting new adequate
1:13:21
knowledge this me ology is called in Russia the adequate adequately uh
1:13:28
complete theory of
1:13:39
control inside this adequately complete uh uh control theory the core thing is
1:13:47
the control uh control fun function complete
1:13:55
function of control cff so and you can understand that CF
1:14:00
describes circulation of Information Society and control starting from the setting Vector of goals to completion of
1:14:11
control so it can be splitted into seven stages of
1:14:21
control even if you look at the events of your life of your everyday life you will definitely see each one of these
1:14:28
seven uh seven
1:14:34
points they are there when you're using selfcontrol when you're using
1:14:39
controlling your own
1:14:47
psychology these uh seven seven principles can also be applied to any uh
1:14:52
object control like the society itself of the world
1:15:05
L each time when your intellect meets something new it it uh it really is
1:15:12
under the pressure of getting understanding this what is new what is
1:15:20
there how can you even know what is new whether this is new to your mentality and to your knowledge or this is an old
1:15:26
thing how can you tell what is new or what is
1:15:32
old you're just your your brain your mentality is just solving the task of whether this is it or this is not
1:15:45
it and definitely at this point your new knowledge is not there embedded into the
1:15:50
into the system of your stereotypes which you have
1:16:04
so each individual intellect creates huge work elaborates hardly over trying
1:16:10
to identify what kind of this what kind of stereotypes could be appli to this novel which you're which
1:16:22
are
1:16:28
I could definitely deliver a very well a big lecture regarding each of the individual stages of the Control
1:16:34
Function but because of lack of time I will just say few words
1:16:46
this then if you have identified this new information new factor and you have put it into into the framework of your
1:16:54
stereotypes then the next stage is you will definitely go and ask yourself what
1:16:59
is the purpose what I want to do with that what is the target of what are my goals about this new
1:17:14
situation so the fourth stage which you definitely follow but you never think about this this is done almost
1:17:21
automatically for you by your intellect is that you are forming concept of control over this new
1:17:31
situation the other things are absolutely easily understandable so you're making a structure or you're
1:17:36
making a vehicle which will bring you to the
1:17:42
goal then you supervise whether the structure is operating properly whether it the structure is really instrumental
1:17:48
to meet your needs
1:17:54
and then at stage seven if the structure has completed the goal which you have identified then you just liquidate the
1:18:01
structure or reform the structure but I would like to ask you
